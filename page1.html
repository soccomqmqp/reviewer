        <h2>What is a Computer</h2>
        <p>
A computer is a complex electronic device that is designed to perform a variety of tasks by executing instructions, processing data, and providing output. It is composed of hardware components, such as a central processing unit (CPU), memory, storage devices, input/output devices, and various interconnected circuits.</p>

        <h3>Hardware vs. software</h3>
        <p>Before we talk about different types of computers, let's talk about two things all computers have in common: <b>hardware</b> and <b>software</b>.</p>
        <BR> <hr>
        <p><b>HARDWARE</b></p>
            <img src="https://quicklearncomputer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Examples-of-Hardware.png">
        <p>
Computer hardware refers to the physical components of a computer that you can touch and see. These parts work together to make a computer function. It's like the body of the computer, including the brain (CPU), memory (like a short-term memory), storage (like a long-term memory), and all the things you use to interact with it, such as the screen, keyboard, and mouse. Just like a puzzle, each hardware piece has a specific role, helping the computer process information, run software, and carry out tasks.</p>
        
         <br> 
        <p><b>SOFTWARE</b></p>
            <img src="https://www.goodcore.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/types-of-software.png">
            <p>Software is the virtual brain of a computer. Unlike hardware, which you can touch, software consists of programs, apps, and instructions that tell the computer what to do. It's like the thoughts and ideas that guide the computer's actions. There are different types of software, such as operating systems that manage the computer's resources, and applications that perform specific tasks like word processing, browsing the internet, or playing games. Software is what brings a computer to life, allowing it to process data, create visuals, play sounds, and perform countless other functions.</p>

            <p>The picture above shows several types of computers and computing devices and is an example of their differences.</p>
            <br>
            <hr>
            
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In simple terms, a computer is a gadget designed for many tasks. It's like a person's brain, but electronic. It has parts like the CPU that thinks and controls, memory that's like short-term memory, and storage that's like long-term memory. There's a monitor to see things, a keyboard and mouse to interact, and other gadgets too. You can use a computer to play, work, study, and more! It's a super useful tool for all sorts of things.</p>
